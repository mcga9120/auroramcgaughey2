Hey! I'm Aurora, a 25-year-old visual designer from Brantford. My specialties include branding solutions, product design, and UX research. I achieved an advanced diploma in Graphic Design from Sheridan College, and am currently working on my BDes from Wilfird Laurier University, specializing in UX design, with a minor in Leadership.

Through my classes, I work on creating accessible products and assisting clients with the research and design solutions for the problems that they bring to us. I was also given the opportunity to become my own client, and build a website based on something that I was interested in. All of these projects involved going through the design process and speaking to users directly to create the best possible solutions.

In my time, I have worked as a freelance graphic designer, working in many areas such as branding, promotional items, and marketing. The companies I have worked for include Jack Nadel International, Habitat for Humanity Brant-Norfolk, Three Inches High, and many more.
